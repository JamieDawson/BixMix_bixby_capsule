My team participated in the Bixby Hackathon that happened at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) created a capsule that's designed to help DJs find songs within a certain genre and BPM.

By simply telling BixMix "Give me 50 techno tracks at 100 beats per minute", BixMix will access the Spotify API and provide a list with of 50 techno songs with 100 BPM. 

But lets say you're not a DJ and don't care about BPM. You can make the request <b>"Give me 10 techno tracks"</b> and BixMix will provide randomize the BPM for you. You can even just say <b>"Give me tracks"</b> and BixMix will even randomly pick a genre, amount of tracks, and tempo for you. So if you just want some background noise, BixMix can do that for you as well.

Once you find some tracks you enjoy. You can tell Bixby to create a new playlist for you. You can even manipulate the playlist by saying commands like "play", "pause", "next", and "one more time".

My team created video showcasing how the capsule works.
