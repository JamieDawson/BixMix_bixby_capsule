My team during the Bixby Hackathon that happened at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) created a capsule that's designed to help DJs find songs within a certain genre and BPM.

By simply telling BixMix "Give me 50 techno tracks at 100 beats per minute", BixMix will access the spotify API and provide a list with of 50 techno songs with 100 BPM. 

But lets say you're not a DJ and don't care about BPM. You can make the request <b>"Give me 10 techno tracks"</b> and BixMix will provide randomize the BPM for you. You can even just say <b>"Give me tracks"</b> and BixMix will even randomly pick a genre, amount of tracks, and tempo for you. So if you just want some background noise, BixMix can do that for you as well.
